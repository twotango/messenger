**#Data Strategy:**

**##ASL-Lex Dataset:**

Utilize additional features such as distances between major and minor locations, spread, flexion, ulnar rotation, neighborhood density, parameter neighborhood density, and phonotactic probability to enhance model accuracy. Calculate phonological complexity to distinguish meaningful "personal signs" from irrelevant motion data.

Consider second-level features like frequency, iconicity, guessability, and sign type to facilitate global and personal sign language applications, especially for tasks like Sign Work/Remote.

Capture thumb, handshape, location, selected fingers, flexion, ulnar rotation, spread, and movement characteristics using smartphone sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) to infer sign attributes. 

Prioritize accessibility by focusing on accelerometer and gyroscope data for widespread usability.

**##Motion Data Feedback Loop:**

Define motion types using gyroscope, accelerometer, and orientation data, including stationary, vertical, and horizontal movements.

Infer motion data even without orientation data through complementary fusion based on XYZ accelerometer and gyroscope data.

Train a model to predict motion types and incorporate them as a new column in the user's dataset. Utilize timestamps, frequency, and duration data to provide contextual assistance within the app.

Integrate motion types into a language model for predicting activity/gesture types. Ensure model fine-tuning based on user feedback through a real-time feedback loop facilitated by Node-RED.

**##Other Considerations:**

Time/Duration: Use a pre-trained model to timestamp "personal gestures" and enhance temporal context.

Frequency: Measure sign occurrence within a timeframe to understand user interaction patterns and preferences.

Iconicity and Guessability: Gather user feedback on sign iconicity and guessability to refine recognition accuracy.

Sign Type: Employ machine learning algorithms to classify signs based on visual features, aiding in differentiating communication styles and enhancing model training.

Tap on the Screen Only: Capture interaction timing and frequency when motion or image data is unavailable, providing insights into user behavior.
Motion or Image Data Only: Leverage motion data for tracking movements and image data for analyzing visual features, depending on available data sources.

Combination of Motion, Image, and Tap Data: Integrate all available data sources to develop robust sign language recognition models, improving accuracy and contextual understanding.

**##Model Learning and User Feedback:**

Implement a combination of user feedback and model learning to refine "personal gestures" and enhance identifier accuracy.

Prioritize labeled data creation for handshape, location, and movement characteristics based on various sensor inputs and user interactions.

Conduct field studies and beta testing to refine parameters, build a global dataset, and research to what degree multimodal signs would be used, advancing application effectiveness.

Enable continuous model learning and adaptation based on user feedback to improve predictions and application capabilities.

Uphold privacy and data security standards by operating locally with reduced parameters and potentially using open-source, locally executable large language models.

Aim for a natively runnable application that updates with improved models trained on larger datasets, providing personalized user experiences with compressed model sizes.
