**#Data Strategy:**

**##ASL-Lex Dataset:**

Utilize additional features such as distances between major and minor locations, spread, flexion, ulnar rotation, neighborhood density, parameter neighborhood density, and phonotactic probability to enhance model accuracy. Calculate phonological complexity to distinguish meaningful "personal signs" from irrelevant motion data.

Consider second-level features like frequency, iconicity, guessability, and sign type to facilitate global and personal sign language applications, especially for tasks like Sign Work/Remote.

Capture thumb, handshape, location, selected fingers, flexion, ulnar rotation, spread, and movement characteristics using smartphone sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) to infer sign attributes. 

Prioritize accessibility by focusing on accelerometer and gyroscope data for widespread usability.

**##Motion Data Feedback Loop:**

[Define](motion_type_function.md) motion types using gyroscope and accelerometer, including stationary, vertical, and horizontal movements.

This could be useful for a simple rule-based approach but also limited in scaleability. 

Therefore, I propose to cluster raw data without assigning motion type descriptions but only predicting gesture meanings. 

**##Image Data Feedback Loop:** 

Fine-tune pre-trained image recognition model to detect and extract defined features of signs/hands. The ASL Lex data set has been useful in extracting relevant features. The fine-tuned image recognition model could be trained and tested with available sign language video and image material. 

A function can be defined to calculate phonological complexity. Motion data will be complemented by image input, providing an additional layer of information. If both models are integrated into a larger model, the advantage is that we can potentially have feedback loops between motion, image, and tap model structures. 

Once gesture predictions are made, a connected natural language model (tiny mini?) could conduct semantic analysis and output suggestions in the interface. Tap input can directly be fed into tiny mini, whereby sensor data (including audio) and time can provide context when which input modality is used and when combined. 

**##Overall Pipeline##:**

For automatization reasons, I favor a clustering approach of data using algorithm like KMeans. To allow for multimodality, I suggest to cluster motion, handshape/sign (image), and screen taps together, if available. 

This could work through API requests, whereby each datastream is uniquely identifiable. Through binary encoding, yes-no, 1-0, different data streams can be included or excluded/skipped in clustering. 

Labels would also be included, if available, otherwise skipped, in clustering. Labels are English translations. 

For further fine-tuning, the clustered data should be classified in gesture vs. no gesture based on baseline model training provided by user in application set up. 

**###The application set up should include###:**

- Personal gesture creation
- Personal gesture meaning = English translation 
- X repeats of personal gesture(s)
- Set up over X time period 
- Set up X time for user feedback: gesture vs. no gesture 

The set up will be used for baseline training and also fed into global models trained on global data of all users. Upon registration an user should get a unique user ID, data base, and connected Python scripts that will be used to fine-tune the global models that will be loaded. The global models will have separate Python scripts with conditions: skip training process if no user data is available; train if new user data is available. 

**Optionally:** Periodically (e.g., weekly), the personal, on user fine-tuned model will be retrained with updated global models and available user data. 

The gesture vs. no gesture classification will also include phonetic complexity and probability, if available, otherwise skipped. 

After gesture vs. no gesture classification, data not considered as gestures could be tagged with ignore tags through masking while data identified as gestures will be further classified in "label (English translation) known" and "UNKNOWN." If known, the predicted label is assigned when confidence (probability) >= threshold X. If confidence < threshold, the gesture will be classified as UNKNOWN instead. If classified as UNKNOWN, a BERT model will make predictions on English translations and will make new predictions for X periods if confidence remains < threshold. If threshold won't be achieved, the gesture will still be classified as UNKNOWN. Periodic (e.g., weekly), random sample user feedback, will be used to fine-tune the BERT model. 

Upon label "English translation/(Lemma ID (encoded))" achieved, other BERT/NLP models will predict emotional sentiment, semantic field, and lexical class, one model for each. Here, again, the BERT/NLP models can be trained with global user data and loaded and fine-tuned for each user separately. They would have separate Python scripts.

Finally, I propose to calculate phonetic complexity, phonetic probability, iconizity, and guessability (through global user feedback) (optional) and train models on each, too. Feedback loops of BERT models will improve these models while  phonetic complexity, phonetic probability, iconizity, and potentially guessability (optional) can be fed into the gesture vs no gesture classification model, closing the feedback loops. The BERT/NLP models and English Translation (Lemma ID), sentiment, semantic field, and lexical class predictions >= threshold can be fed into clustering model, otherwise skipped, for retraining, integrating these into a feedback loop as well. 

**###Pipeline of models###:** 

1. Clustering based on available data streams (motion, hand image, and screen tap)
2. Gesture vs. no gesture classification
3. English translation (Lemma ID) known vs UNKNOWN classification 
4. BERT/NLP models 
    1. English translation (Lemma ID) prediction
    2. Emotional sentiment (positive/negative/neutral) analysis
    3. Semantic field analysis 
    4. Lexical class classification 
5. Phonetic complexity
6. Phonetic probability 
7. Iconizity
8. Guessability (optional)

**##Mathematical formula:##**

1. Phonetic Complexity = X * (one-hot encoded motion) + X * (one-hot encoded image sign) + X * (one-hot encoded screen tap)
2. Phonotactic Probability = (Lemma ID * X) / Total Lemma ID
3. Guessability = (X * one-hot encoded 1) / Total sampled of global user survey
4. Iconicity = (Phonetic Complexity * Lemma ID) / Guessability

**##Other Considerations:**

Time/Duration: Use a pre-trained model to timestamp "personal gestures" and enhance temporal context.

Frequency: Measure sign occurrence within a timeframe to understand user interaction patterns and preferences.

Iconicity and Guessability: Gather user feedback on sign iconicity and guessability to refine recognition accuracy.

Sign Type: Employ machine learning algorithms to classify signs based on visual features, aiding in differentiating communication styles and enhancing model training.

Tap on the Screen Only: Capture interaction timing and frequency when motion or image data is unavailable, providing insights into user behavior.
Motion or Image Data Only: Leverage motion data for tracking movements and image data for analyzing visual features, depending on available data sources.

Combination of Motion, Image, and Tap Data: Integrate all available data sources to develop robust sign language recognition models, improving accuracy and contextual understanding.

The model trainings should happen in the cloud because they are computationally intensive. 

**##Model Learning and User Feedback:**

Implement a combination of user feedback and model learning to refine "personal gestures" and enhance identifier accuracy.

Conduct field studies and beta testing to refine parameters, build a global dataset, and research to what degree multimodal signs would be used, advancing application effectiveness.

Enable continuous model learning and adaptation based on user feedback to improve predictions and application capabilities.

Uphold privacy and data security standards by operating locally with reduced parameters and potentially using open-source, locally executable large language models.

Aim for a natively runnable application that updates with improved models trained on larger datasets, providing personalized user experiences with compressed model sizes.
