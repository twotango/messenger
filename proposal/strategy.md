**#Data Strategy:**

**##ASL-Lex Dataset:**

Utilize additional features such as distances between major and minor locations, spread, flexion, ulnar rotation, neighborhood density, parameter neighborhood density, and phonotactic probability to enhance model accuracy. Calculate phonological complexity to distinguish meaningful "personal signs" from irrelevant motion data.

Consider second-level features like frequency, iconicity, guessability, and sign type to facilitate global and personal sign language applications, especially for tasks like Sign Work/Remote.

Capture thumb, handshape, location, selected fingers, flexion, ulnar rotation, spread, and movement characteristics using smartphone sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) to infer sign attributes. 

Prioritize accessibility by focusing on accelerometer and gyroscope data for widespread usability.

**##Motion Data Feedback Loop:**

**Transferring Whisper capabilities to motion data:**

In the case of motion data, accelerometer, and gyroscope data have to be preprocessed to create representations similar to audio spectrograms. This could involve converting the raw motion data into a suitable format, such as time-series data, and then transforming it into a format that resembles log-mel spectrograms.

Once having preprocessed the motion data into a suitable representation, the data can be fed into the Transformer encoder in place of the audio spectrograms. The encoder would then extract important features from the motion data, similar to how it processes audio features.

The decoder would then generate text tokens autoregressively based on the hidden state representations from the encoder and the previously predicted tokens. This process would allow Whisper to incorporate a language model internally, enabling it to generate accurate text transcriptions based on the input motion data.

In summary, while Whisper was initially designed for automatic speech recognition using audio spectrograms, its architecture could potentially be adapted to work with motion data from accelerometers and gyroscopes by preprocessing the data and feeding it into the model in a similar manner.

**Open question:** Will there be a feedback button for explicit/implicit feedback regarding motion recognition when interacting with the app (displaying the motion and predicted translation?)?

**##Image Data Feedback Loop:** 

Fine-tune pre-trained image recognition model Google MediaPipe to detect and extract defined features of signs/hands. The ASL Lex data set has been useful in extracting relevant features. The fine-tuned image recognition model could be trained and tested with available sign language video and image material. 

Optional: 
A function can be defined to calculate phonological complexity. Motion data will be complemented by image input, providing an additional layer of information. If both models are integrated into a larger model, the advantage is that we can potentially have feedback loops between motion, image, and tap model structures. With Whisper and TinyLlama we have to reconsider this usage. 

**Google MediaPipe can be customized as follows:** https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/customization/gesture_recognizer

Prepare your input as an image file or a numpy array, then convert it to a media pipe. Image object. If your input is a video file or live stream from a webcam, you can use an external library such as OpenCV to load your input frames as numpy arrays.

The dataset for gesture recognition in the model maker requires the following format: <dataset_path>/<label_name>/<img_name>.*. In addition, one of the label names (label_names) must be none. The none label represents any gesture that isn't classified as one of the other gestures.

Possibly MediaPipe allows customization to include minor location and major location of hands, signtype, and any other categories to describe the hand. Users can generally create new sign gestures by recording and naming these. The name will be the gesture label MediaPipe attempts to predict and pass along to TinyLlama.

**##Tiny Llamma##:**

1. Concatenate descriptions from all sources in the "input" column, ordered sequentially by timestamp.
2. Format the dataset with two columns: "input" containing concatenated descriptions and "output" containing desired sentence suggestions from TinyLlama.
3. Fine-tune TinyLlama using the prepared dataset, aiming to generate sentence suggestions based on the provided input descriptions.
4. Integrate RLHF into the training process to continuously refine TinyLlama's performance based on user feedback. This involves:
 1. Explicit feedback: thumb up/thumb down. Thumb up can be encoded as 1 and thumb down as "-1."
 2. Policy: The higher the value, the better. 
 3. Use RL4LMs that offer building blocks for fine-tuning and evaluating LLMs with a wide variety of RL algorithms (PPO, NLPO, A2C, and TRPO), reward functions, and metrics. 

**###The application set up should include###:**

1. Whisper (for motion data)
2. Google MediaPipe (Gesture recognition)
3. TinyLlama: Sentence suggestions based on input descriptions, coming from motion, image, and digitally tapped words/sentences. 

**##Model Learning and User Feedback:**

Implement a combination of user feedback and model learning to refine "personal gestures" and enhance identifier accuracy.

Conduct field studies and beta testing to refine parameters, build a global dataset, and research to what degree multimodal signs would be used, advancing application effectiveness.

Enable continuous model learning and adaptation based on user feedback to improve predictions and application capabilities.

Uphold privacy and data security standards by operating locally with reduced parameters and potentially using open-source, locally executable large language models.

Aim for a natively runnable application that updates with improved models trained on larger datasets, providing personalized user experiences with compressed model sizes.
